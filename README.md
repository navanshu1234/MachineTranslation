Note: This is only small preview of whole code. You can get an idea how the app works.
The front-end is created using KivyMD GUI components, the front-end code is present in demo1.py file.
Use main.py to run the code after importing all the libraries.
note: you can face some problem with kivymd version and python version comptability so first test the suitable version through some yt tutorial that whether kivy version works with your python version or not. try running some test code for it first from tutorial.
